# odin-recipes

This recipes project will include all the html learnings in one recipe webpage. These learnings include the following: the basics of the boilerplate set up, bold and italicized text, ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs, absolute and relative links, and images with the included alt text. 

So far I have added two recipes with ordered and unordered lists. On the home page I utilized an unordered list to organize the links to the recipes. On the recipe pages I added a link back to the home or "recipe directory." On the brussels sprouts page I also added an unordered list since in addition to the home link, I added a link to the cookie recipe. I plan to add another recipe or two to continue practicing and have a full meal with links between the pages. 

Added a chicken recipe with a link to the brussels sprouts for a side and a link to go back to the recipe directory. I was able to make this recipe page without referencing any notes and ran into no issues. I feel confident in my html abilities that I learned thus far.
